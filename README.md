# List Meister
Custom list/shopping-list app built in React Native (Expo).

There is a Current List which contains your items to check off/complete as required.

There is also a "Master List" which contains regularly used items - these can be selected and copied into the "Current List" to reduce typing.

You can add custom, one-off items into the current list.

All items can be checked/marked as completed, or deleted, and they can be dragged to reorder their position in the list.

All changes are persisted as the lists are stored on local device storage.
